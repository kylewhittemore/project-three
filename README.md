# Canna-Keeper
Final Bootcamp Project by: Andrew Anc, Jan Jakubowski, Kyle Whittemore

## Overview:
Canna-Keeper is the hobbyist cannabis growers go to application for logging, detailing, tracking and reviewing cannabis grows. Like any other hobby, practice, repitition and reflection upon your grow can help you improve the overall end product with each harvest. With Canna-Keeper, the hobby grower of all experiences can learn from their past seasons by referencing the logged information.

## Details:

Canna-Keeper allows users to set up personal accounts to track their grows. The user can create a new "Season" and input the recommended information about that season (Strain name, environment type like lights and growing medium, the light wattage, breeder information and even a picture to represent the season). 

From there, the user is able to log and track their daily events using the Daily Log form. Logs do not need to be daily, but represent each event the grower wants to track. This can range from simply observing the garden and recording the findings to watering, transplanting, feeding, cropping, training, switching to flower, deficiencies, photos, notes and more. 

Logs are linked to the specific season the user is working on. A history of logs can be viewed for the user to refer back to. Logs can be edited and deleted by the user if needed. A history of seasons can also be viewed. The user can dive into any past season to view more grow details by looking through the daily logs.

The dashboard is an incredibly helpful part of the application. If a user has one season, this becomes their default season. If a user has more than one season, they can indicate which season is the default season by marking this on the seasons page. The default season's information is represented in the dashboard area. What's important for the user here, is to easily see what the last event was (taken from the daily log) and to understand what the temperature and humidty fluctuations have been over time - both of which are represented in easy to view charts. 

At the end of each season, the hobbyist can review the information to understand what happened over the course of their most recent grow. Visually seeing temperature/humidty spikes or dips and the frequency helps a grower in the future by saying, "Hey, I need to get a better grasp of temperature control this round to see what effect it has on this strain". This idea can be linked with all aspects of growing - from watering frequency, to feeding and length of time spent in vegetative state.

## Technologies Used:
React.js, AWS s3 Bucket, JWT, Express, MongoDB, SCSS, various NPM packages and HTML tools.

## Future:
In the future, we'd like to have a live dashboard. Essentially, allowing the user to build a temperature/humidity monitor (DIY with instructions provided by us) and view live information from the dashboard. We'd also like to branch out to hydroponic growers and create a dynamic table that allows the grower to manipulate a tables length and information to fit the quantity of nutrients and supplies used. 

THe future here is then endless. Being able to automate and view a grow, all within a hobbyist's budget, from your mobile device or computer is ultimate goal.
